\section{Acknowledgement}

I like to thank Prof. Dr.-Ing. Elke Pulverm√ºller for being a great and patient mentor for this project.
She helped me a to get through the messy process of fitting my personal project into the form of a Bachelor Thesis.
I also have to thank Apl. Prof. Dr. Kai-Christoph Hamborg for going over the usability part of this thesis.
Finally, I need to thank the creators of Julia and LLVM. These two great projects build the foundation for this thesis and without them, this thesis would miss its most crucial foundation.
