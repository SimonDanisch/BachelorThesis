\section{Acknowledgement}

I like to thank Prof. Dr.-Ing. Elke Pulverm√ºller for being a great and patient mentor for this project.
She helped me a to get through the messy process of fitting my personal project into the form of a Bachelor Thesis.
I also have to thank Apl. Prof. Dr. Kai-Christoph Hamborg for going over the usability part of this thesis.
My greatest respect goes out to the creators of Julia and LLVM. 
These two excellent projects build the foundation for this thesis and without them, this thesis would miss its most crucial foundation.
Finally, I have to thank Valentin Churavy and Steve Kelly for the tiring task of proof reading this thesis.
