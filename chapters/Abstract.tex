This bachelor thesis is about writing a simple scripting environment for scientific computing, with focus on visualizations and interaction.
Focus on visualization means, that every variable can be inspected and visualized at runtime, ranging from a textual representation to complex 3D scenes.
Interaction is achieved by offering simple GUI elements for all parts of the program and the visualizations.
All libraries are implemented in Julia and modern OpenGL, to offer top notch performance, opening the world to scientists which work which large datasets.
Julia is a novel high-level programming language for scientific computing, promising to match C speed.
